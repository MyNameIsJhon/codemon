# 🧠 Codemon — Learn C While Playing!

![Alt text](https://github.com/MyNameIsJhon/codemon/blob/main/codemon.png "a title")
Welcome to **Codemon**, a game concept born during the _Hackston - Citizen of Wallonia_ hackathon.  
This project is an **educational C-based game** designed to teach programming in a fun and engaging way — think _Pokémon_, but where battles are code challenges and exploration improves your coding skills.

> ⚠️ **Project in early development stage.** Currently, you can move your character around — collision detection and game objectives are coming soon!

## 🚀 About the Project

Codemon is an open-source C project designed as both a game and a learning tool.  
The long-term vision is to build a complete retro-style adventure game where players progress by writing and understanding C code — compiling, debugging, and solving real programming problems inside the game world.

## 🧪 Build & Run

Codemon uses a lightweight custom build system called `cBuilder`, compatible with both **Linux** and **macOS**.

### 🔧 Build & Launch (Linux/macOS)

```bash
./cBuilder.c      # Compile the build system
./cBuilder exec   # Build and launch the game
```
